//! Policy-based authorization gates.
//!
//! Mirrors Laravel's `Gate` facade: register named abilities (or full
//! `Policy` impls keyed by resource type) against the global gate, then
//! call `Gate::allows("update", &user, &post)` from anywhere — controllers,
//! middleware, Inertia view models.
//!
//! The [`Authorizable`] shim adds `user.can("update", &post)` directly on
//! the user type for a more fluent call site.
